### **Core Documents** ‚úÖ
1. **[README.md](README.md)** - Quick start, deployment commands, basic usage
2. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Complete architecture overview, design decisions
3. **[K8S_INTEGRATION.md](K8S_INTEGRATION.md)** - Kubernetes manifests, ArgoCD setup
4. **[SSM_ACCESS.md](SSM_ACCESS.md)** - SSM port-forwarding guide, troubleshooting

### **Build Tools**

## üóëÔ∏è **Files Recommended for Deletion**

The following files are now **outdated** or **redundant** (information merged into core docs):

### **Outdated Planning/Audit Files:**
- `TODO.txt` - Old planning notes, work is complete
- `ereaserdiagram.txt` - Old architecture diagram, superseded by ARCHITECTURE.md
- `PROJECT_AUDIT.md` - Audit complete, all issues fixed

### **Implementation Tracking (Now Complete):**
- `ARCHITECTURE_CLARIFICATIONS.md` - Merged into ARCHITECTURE.md
- `HOSTNAME_CONSISTENCY_UPDATE.md` - Changes complete, info in ARCHITECTURE.md
- `PRIVATE_DNS_SETUP.md` - Setup complete, info in ARCHITECTURE.md
- `NETWORK_MIGRATION.md` - Migration complete

### **Superseded Documentation:**
- `SSM_ACCESS_SETUP.md` - Replaced by cleaner SSM_ACCESS.md

## ‚úÖ **Cleanup Commands**

To remove outdated files:

```bash
cd /home/or/devops-share

# Remove outdated documentation
rm -f TODO.txt \
      ereaserdiagram.txt \
      PROJECT_AUDIT.md \
      ARCHITECTURE_CLARIFICATIONS.md \
      HOSTNAME_CONSISTENCY_UPDATE.md \
      PRIVATE_DNS_SETUP.md \
      NETWORK_MIGRATION.md \
      SSM_ACCESS_SETUP.md

# Verify clean state
ls *.md
# Should show only:
# - ARCHITECTURE.md
# - K8S_INTEGRATION.md  
# - README.md
# - SSM_ACCESS.md
```

## üìñ **Documentation Purpose Summary**

| Document | Purpose | Audience |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **README.md** | Quick start, deployment basics | All users, first-time setup |
| **ARCHITECTURE.md** | Deep dive: network, DNS, security, design decisions | Engineers, detailed understanding |
| **K8S_INTEGRATION.md** | Kubernetes manifests, controllers, ArgoCD setup | K8s/DevOps engineers |
| **SSM_ACCESS.md** | How to access private services, troubleshooting | Developers, daily usage |

## üéØ **Result: Clean, Maintainable Documentation**

**Before:** 11 documentation files (many redundant/outdated)  
**After:** 4 focused, current, well-organized files

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Easy to find information
- ‚úÖ No conflicting/outdated information  
- ‚úÖ Clear purpose for each document
- ‚úÖ Easy to maintain going forward

---

## üîÑ **Ongoing Maintenance**

### **When to Update Each Document:**

- **README.md**: When deployment process changes
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: When adding new stacks or major architectural changes
- **K8S_INTEGRATION.md**: When updating controllers, adding new manifests
- **SSM_ACCESS.md**: When changing access patterns or adding services

### **Don't Create:**
- Temporary tracking documents (use Git commits/PRs instead)
- Duplicate information (link to existing docs)
- Implementation-specific docs (add to main docs when complete)
