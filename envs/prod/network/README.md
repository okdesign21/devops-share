# Production Network Stack - TODO
# This will be populated when ready for prod deployment
# Copy from ../dev/network/ and adjust for production requirements

# Key differences for prod:
# - No CICD instances (GitLab/Jenkins only in dev)
# - Smaller NAT instance or NAT Gateway
# - Production-grade security groups
# - Multi-AZ setup if needed
